# iwd_aks
use of intelligent water drop code for software/code testing by creating a control dependency graph of statements and applying this algorithm to get the knowledge of cost of each path to travel for providing test cases so that with less test cases evaluation can be optimized and preventing the use of evaluation using exhaustive test cases.
the document and the research paper used in for creating this algorithm is provided in the repo.
it contains both a initial iwd and a more optimized modified iwd and using the initial iwd.
